<p>Am delighted to report that it has been another record year for Grill Caterers & Consultants when student members have substantially increased for the 12th year in succession. We are also happy to see that we have graduated five hundred and fifty student members since its inception.</p>

<p>With the current economic situation which is forcing businesses to change the way they work, competition is mounting and professionals have to be the best to get a head by continually updating skills and knowledge which is essential for skill progression. With this in mind, we strongly believe that our member students will also need to have access to flexible continuing skill development solutions (CSD)</p>

<p>Grill Caterers & Consultants has established a powerful strategic partnership with national skills Training and development providers such as TEVETA and Mzuzu Informal skills Training Providers Association (MZUISTPA) that through them student members can benefit coaching and training support provided by them.
MZUISTPA provides members with skills and talents development which enable us to offer solutions to meet the member’s specific needs.</p>

<p>Finally, we actively participate in influencing life-skill career in the longer term so that someone becomes a different person in the society. Mind you, everyone has a chance to stand out to learn, improve and build his/her skills. The more they learn from courses, books and other people, the more they can offer back.
It’s important to strive and make their brand more useful and valuable to others and they are not their own, Grill Caterers will help them achieve a distinction in skill development and brand building</p>
