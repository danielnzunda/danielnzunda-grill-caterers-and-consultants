			Am Aaron Mkandawire working for Mayoka village in Nkhataby as a Chef.I was once a student at Grill Caterers from 2019 2020.After completing my trainings in Hotel and Catering management, I was attached to mayoka village where I took three months working as a trainee. Upon completing my trainings, I was advantaged to continue working as full-time employee as a senior chef. I thank God for His mercies upon me for the opportunity given to me through Grill Caterers which made me to be what am today.
            For those wishing to do hospitality career, I advise them to have confidence in Grill Caterers in order for them to fully make their dreams come true provided they have determination that can make them achieve their goals. For more details about my advice, you are free to come at Mayoka or call me on 0880507050.

			Am Onipher Msiska working for Sunbird Mzuzu Hotel as a Waitress .It is so rewarding for me to work for this wonderful and descent place.
            Am one of the former student members of Grill Caterers where I was trained and became a waitress a position I dreamt of.
            I thank God for His mercies to kindly show me where I was supposed to go and get trained for hospitality career. I will also take this opportunity to give thanks to my beloved lecturer and director who enthusiastically made it easier for me to be what am today and enjoy this wonderful job. It is so rewarding and satisfactory. If it were not Grill Caterers, I do not think if I would make it. The place (Grill Caterers) looks simple and local but its services can take you far beyond your expectations if properly made use of them. The institution offers both theory and practical trainings for one to fully understand the whole career.

			Am  Queen Mwakasungula working at OSIS Lodge as a House keeper just in Mzuzu City. I was once a student member at Grill Caterers where I studied Hotel and Catering Management which its emphasis lies in food production and Customer care (hospitality)
            Am happy that am working because I was trained by Grill Caterers otherwise I would not be here for work because i had nothing that could qualify me for the job.
